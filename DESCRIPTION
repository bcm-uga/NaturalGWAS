Title: Simulation of Phenotypes for Natural Gwas
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Olivier François

Description: This package contains functions for reproducing the analyses described in (Francois and Caye 2017). 
The package allows simulating phenotypes from genotypes by including realistic GxE interactions and confounders. 
It also runs an oracle method, that estimates associations of genotypes with a simulated trait by using the 
true confounders that generated the simulation. The package enables comparisons of methods that evaluate causality 
from the data with the oracle approach.
